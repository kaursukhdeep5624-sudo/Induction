 ### *Day 2 ( 1 August,2025)*
 My 2nd day of college started a bit differently.As soon as we arrived, we had to give a test in English and Maths.this test is very helpful to switch our minds into study mode and get back into learning zone.After the test we were guided to the auditorium for a session. The session is delievered by **Dr.Arashdeep Singh** on "Food:-A pivotel Role in students's overall wellness but the session is not just about healthy food-it went much deeper.He talked about how food is connected to our health which type of food we should consume on daily basis and i like this session very much. What made the more session relatable and interesting is the way he explained it in simple language.
 
 After we had an interactive session with  _**causmic club**_ . They introduced us to **Github** which is platform used by students and may others to share and manage code or project. For most of us it was new concept but they explained it very well. After that they gave us a task to make and upload our view ,observation and our experience about induction program . It was a great way to get hands on experience and understand how github works . It felt good to do something practical on the very first days of our collegeg . It also made us realize how important its is to get familier with tools like Github early on our tech journey.
